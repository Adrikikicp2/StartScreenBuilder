# StartScreen
A Recreation of the Windows 8.x Start Screen<br>
Made with .NET C# using WPF and WinForms
## Differences with ScreenLaunch and StartScreen
### StartScreen
The main app that has the StartScreen Component<br>
This is has the Tile System and other stuff<br>
Made using WPF C# .NET
### ScreenLaunch
The app that launches the StartScreen app<br>
this is also used to check if the User has clicked the start button or not<br>
Made using WinForms C# .NET
## Known Issues
- High Memory Usage (100 - 500mb, depends on how many apps the users has installed)<br>
Note: This clears to around ~100mb when Hidden (Thanks to GC), but its still alot
## Any help with the code/assets is appreciated
